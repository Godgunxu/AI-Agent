print("\n✅ WHAT'S BEEN FIXED:")
print("1. ❌ OLD: Required documents to be uploaded before any questions")
print("2. ✅ NEW: Can answer general questions even without documents")
print("3. ✅ NEW: Automatically switches between document and general mode")
print("4. ✅ NEW: Enhanced prompts for better programming/technical answers")

print("\n🧠 GENERAL Q&A MODE (No documents needed):")
examples = [
    "python bubble sort",
    "explain quantum physics",
    "write a React component",
    "how to use Git",
    "machine learning basics",
    "SQL join types",
    "JavaScript async/await"
]

for example in examples:
    print(f"  • \"{example}\"")

print("\n📚 DOCUMENT Q&A MODE (When PDFs are uploaded):")
doc_examples = [
    "Summarize the main findings",
    "What methodology was used?",
    "Compare the results across studies",
    "What are the limitations mentioned?"
]

for example in doc_examples:
    print(f"  • \"{example}\"")

print("\n🔧 HOW IT WORKS:")
print("1. App checks if documents are loaded")
print("2. With documents: Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)")
print("3. Without documents: Uses general LLM knowledge")
print("4. Different welcome messages and hints for each mode")
print("5. Status indicators show which mode is active")

print("\n🚀 TO TEST:")
print("1. Start the app (no documents needed)")
print("2. Ask: 'python bubble sort algorithm'")
print("3. Should get a detailed code example!")
print("4. Add PDFs to get document-specific Q&A")

print("\n💡 The AI can now handle ANY question, not just document-based ones!")
