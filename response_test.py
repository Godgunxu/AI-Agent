print("\n📊 TOKEN LIMITS IMPROVED:")
print("Before:")
print("  • Fast mode: 384 tokens (very short responses)")
print("  • Normal mode: 768 tokens (still limited)")
print("\nAfter:")
print("  • Fast mode + Detailed: 1536 tokens (3-4x longer)")
print("  • Normal mode + Detailed: 2048 tokens (nearly 3x longer)")

improvements = [
    "Increased token limits for longer, complete responses",
    "Added 'Detailed Responses' toggle in settings (enabled by default)",
    "Enhanced prompt template for more comprehensive answers",
    "Automatic retry mechanism for truncated responses",
    "Better retrieval with more source documents (4-5 vs 2-3)",
    "Improved error handling and user feedback",
    "Higher temperature (0.3) for more natural responses"

print("\n💡 USAGE TIPS:")
tips = [
    "Keep 'Detailed responses' enabled for comprehensive answers",
    "Use Fast mode only when you need quick, shorter responses",
    "The system now automatically retries if responses seem cut off",
    "DeepSeek models work especially well with detailed mode",
    "Longer context means better understanding of complex documents"
